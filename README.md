This code was my first coding experience. I built a website for a graphic designer who wanted to showcase their work online.

## Features
1. This website is designed to simulate a desktop, with app icons and windows.
2. The app icons have hover state and open and close states.
3. The apps open modals that are draggable within the window! This is similar to how you can drag a window on desktop.
4. The content within each modal includes Google Drive integration, embedded links and downloadable pdfs.
5. The modals open with a fancy animation.
6. Custom mouse implementation.
